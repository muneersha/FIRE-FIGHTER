# FIRE FIGHTER
The proposed project aims to develop an android controlled fire fighter robot that can be used to extinguish fires through remote handling. The vehicle consists of a water tank along with a pump which can throw water when needed.
The whole system works on a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ . The android device is used as a transmitter to send over controlling commands to the vehicle, for which an android based application is developed. The android app provides a good touch based GUI for controlling the robot vehicle.
Communication between Smartphone and the robot is made possible with the help of Raspberry Pi 3 and the built in Wi-Fi module on the Raspberry Pi 3. Then the motors are controlled using a driver IC based on the commands received for the vehicle movements in front, back, left and right directions. It uses WI-FI technology for communication, allowing the vehicle to operate from anywhere in the world based on IOT. There is a GPS module to obtain the location of the robot. A camera is fixed on the robot for visualise the objects to the smartphone for easy controlling of the vehicle.
